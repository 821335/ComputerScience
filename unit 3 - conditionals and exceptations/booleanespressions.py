#boolean expression
# kinda like a mathematical formula
# can only evaluate to true or false
# are my shoes tied? - true
# is 5 > 7 false
print(5 > 7)

# comparison opertaors! == > < >= <=
# kinda like arithmetic operators! + - * ** //
x = 5               #set x equal to 5, tell it what to be
print(x == 5)         # get x equals 5, ask a question
#the difference is that we are using one or two equal signs
#this is a perfect test question

print(4 >=2)        #true
print(1993 == 1993)     #true
print(-90 < -99)            #false
print(10 != 10)         #False. "bash" "not"


#boolean expression quiz
answer_one = input("give me a integer that is negative")
answer_one = int(answer_one)
print(answer_one < 0)

answer_two = input("write the number 5\n")
#answer_two = int(answer_two)   this is unnecessary!
print(answer_two == "5")

print("walrus" == "walrus")     # == is totally valid for 2 strings
